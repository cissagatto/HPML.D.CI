# Labels-Chains-HPML
This code is part of my Ph.D. research. The objective is to test the best chosen hybrid partitions with silhouette coefficient. It's called HPML Label Chains because we use Ensemble of Classifier Chains to test, this means that the labels are randomly chained within each cluster.
